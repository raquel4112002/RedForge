## Commands

```bash
RedForge skills search "calendar"
RedForge skills search --limit 20 --json
RedForge skills install <slug>
RedForge skills install <slug> --version <version>
RedForge skills install <slug> --force
RedForge skills update <slug>
RedForge skills update --all
RedForge skills list
RedForge skills list --eligible
RedForge skills list --json
RedForge skills list --verbose
RedForge skills info <name>
RedForge skills info <name> --json
RedForge skills check
RedForge skills check --json
```

`search`/`install`/`update` use ClawHub directly and install into the active
workspace `skills/` directory. `list`/`info`/`check` still inspect the local
skills visible to the current workspace and config.

This CLI `install` command downloads skill folders from ClawHub. Gateway-backed
skill dependency installs triggered from onboarding or Skills settings use the
separate `skills.install` request path instead.

Notes:

- `search [query...]` accepts an optional query; omit it to browse the default
  ClawHub search feed.
- `search --limit <n>` caps returned results.
- `install --force` overwrites an existing workspace skill folder for the same
  slug.
- `update --all` only updates tracked ClawHub installs in the active workspace.
- `list` is the default action when no subcommand is provided.
- `list`, `info`, and `check` write their rendered output to stdout. With
  `--json`, that means the machine-readable payload stays on stdout for pipes
  and scripts.
